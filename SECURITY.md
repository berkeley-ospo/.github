# Security

The UC Berkeley OSPO team and community take security issues seriously.
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings,
and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, to report a security issue, please use the "Report a Vulnerability" button on
the GitHub Security Advisory tab.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can:

  * The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
